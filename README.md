Track That Track

This is the front end for my capstone project.

This app was made for music lovers that are looking for a place to digitally organize their record collection. This app allows users to enter information about a record they own and digitally store the record in their collection. Users may also create a wish list for a record they want to add to their collection in the future. Users may update and delete records as needed.


Track That Track (c) Value Proposition:
As someone who has a rather large record collection, I know that it is hard to organize and maintain all of my records. When I am at a record store or a garage sale I can never remember the records I have. Track That Track easily allows you to digitally take your record collection with you wherever you need it and also create a wish list for records that you want to add. You can also store images of the record cover so you can visually see what records you have and want. This is a must have for all record collectors who have a growing record collection.
